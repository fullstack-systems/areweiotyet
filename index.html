<h2>What is Rust?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the core Rust language, compiler and tools, Rust includes
<a href="http://doc.crates.io/guide.html">Cargo</a>, a dependency management and build tool,
and <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>, the Rust community's central package host.</p>
<h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet of things (IoT), is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as &quot;connected devices&quot; and &quot;smart devices&quot;), buildings and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This site groups IoT components into three basic categories: <strong>devices</strong> which have processors, sensors
and actuators, <strong>protocols</strong> that specify how devices communicate, and the <strong>infrastructure</strong> which
connects the devices with the applications that use them.</p>
<h2>Why is the IoT important to the Rust Community?</h2>
<p>The IoT is a fast growing application domain that presents a huge opportunity to expand the use of Rust.
It's requirements (particularly safety and security on often resource constrained networked devices) are a good match
for the language and community's strengths.</p>
<h2>Why is Rust important to the IoT Community?</h2>
<p>As the IoT grows, it faces the same problems that the larger Internet is struggling with: providing reliable
services at scale in the face of malicious actors. Rust provides a language and ecosystem to build the next
generation of IoT devices and infrastructure with a modern foundation designed with these concerns in mind.</p>
<h1>Topics &amp; Resources</h1>
<h2>Environments</h2>
<p>Rust offers an impressive dynamic range: it is suitable for targeting a wide range of targets, from
bare-metal single-chip, limited memory MCUs such as ARM and MIPS SoCs to Linux NUMA servers with hundreds
of cores and terabytes of main memory. This section focuses on those environments that are most
important for a wide range of IoT devices: bare-metal SoCs and small Linux systems.</p>
<h3>Bare Metal</h3>
<h3>RTOS</h3>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<h2>Protocols</h2>
<p>There are a wide range of protocols used for the IoT, from general purpose protocols like HTTP to
application specific ones such as ModBus that are used within a single industry and proprietary ones
that might be used by a single vendor or product.</p>
<h3>General Purpose</h3>
<h3>Application Specific</h3>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>While much of the focus is on IoT devices, almost all IoT systems are designed with additional
components such as Gateways, Middleboxes (load balancers, firewalls, and other tools), and
Endpoints (which send and receive data from the devices).</p>
<h3>Gateways</h3>
<h3>Middleboxes</h3>
<h3>Endpoints</h3>

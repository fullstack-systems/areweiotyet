<h1>Is Rust IoT yet?</h1>
<h2>What is Rust?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the core Rust language, compiler and tools, Rust includes
<a href="http://doc.crates.io/guide.html">Cargo</a>, a dependency management and build tool,
and <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>, the Rust community's central package host.</p>
<h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet of things (IoT), is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as &quot;connected devices&quot; and &quot;smart devices&quot;), buildings and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of this site, the IoT consists of several components: Devices which have processors, sensors
and actuators, Protocols that specify how Devices communicate, and Infrastructure, which is used to build
networked systems of these Devices.</p>
<h2>Why is the IoT important to the Rust Community?</h2>
<p>The IoT (including devices and infrastructure) is a fast growing application domain that presents
a huge opportunity to expand the use of Rust. It's requirements (safety and security on often resource
constrained networked devices) are a good match to the language and community's strengths.</p>
<h2>Why is Rust important to the IoT Community?</h2>
<p>As the IoT grows, it faces the same problems that the larger Internet is
struggling with: providing reliable services at scale in the face of malicious actors. Rust provides
a language and ecosystem to build the next generation of IoT devices and infrastructure using a modern
foundation designed with these concerns in mind.</p>

# Is Rust IoT yet?

## What is Rust?

> [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. 

## What is the Internet of Things?

> The internet of things (IoT), is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)

## Why is the IoT important to the Rust Community?

The IoT (including devices and infrastructure) is a fast growing application domain that presents
a huge opportunity to expand the use of Rust. It's requirements (safety and security on often resource 
constrained networked devices) are a good match to the language and community's strengths.

## Why is Rust important to the IoT Community?

As the IoT grows, it faces the same problems that the larger Internet is
struggling with: providing reliable services at scale in the face of malicious actors. Rust provides
a language and ecosystem to build the next generation of IoT devices and infrastructure using a modern
foundation designed with these concerns in mind.

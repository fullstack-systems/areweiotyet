# Are We IoT Yet

This project presents an overview of the IoT (Internet of Things, or connected embedded devices in general)
and the state of Rust's ecosystem for developing IoT devices, protocols, and services. The goal is to make
IoT related Rust projects more discoverable and to promote the use of Rust for connected embedded devices.

An additional goal is to produce a roadmap highlighting areas where additional development is needed to
make Rust a suitable choice. Hopefully this will inspire individuals and companies to invest the effort
that can make this happen.

## What is the IoT?

There is a considerable amount of hype around the term IoT. This project defines the term broadly: systems
built from networked embedded devices. These systems are not new; they have existed since the dawn of the
Internet. They include more than the devices themselves; they also include the networking protocols that these 
devices use to communicate, the networking infrastructure used to support these protocols, and the servers
that collect and analyze the data.
